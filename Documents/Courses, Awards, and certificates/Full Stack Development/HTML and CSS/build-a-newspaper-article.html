      <p class="text">A powerful and unexpected snowstorm swept through the Rocky Mountains late Tuesday evening, leaving a group of hikers stranded on the popular Longs Peak trail. The storm, which brought heavy snowfall and near-zero visibility, forced search and rescue teams to conduct a late-night operation to bring the hikers to safety.</p>
      <p class="text">According to local authorities, the group of five set out on their hike early in the morning, expecting mild conditions. However, a sudden weather shift brought intense snowfall and strong winds, making the descent treacherous. A distress call was made just before sundown, prompting an immediate response from park rangers and rescue teams.</p>
      <p class="text">Despite the dangerous conditions, all five hikers were located and escorted down the mountain by early Wednesday morning. None of them sustained serious injuries, though they were treated for mild hypothermia. Officials are reminding visitors to check weather forecasts thoroughly before heading into the backcountry, as spring storms can arrive unexpectedly.</p>
